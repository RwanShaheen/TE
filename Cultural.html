                    <h4><b>Description</b></h4>
                    <p>
                        The Giza pyramid complex (also called the Giza necropolis) is an 
                         archaeological site on the Giza plateau in Greater Cairo, Egypt. The 
                         complex includes the Great Pyramid, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the 
                         Pyramid of Menkaure along with their associated pyramid complexes 
                         and the Sphinx statue. These pyramids were all built during the 
                         Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom in ancient Egypt between 2600
                         and 2500 BC. The site also includes several tombs and the remains of 
                         a workers' village.
                     <p>
                         The Great Pyramid and the Pyramid of Khafre are among the largest 
                         pyramids built in ancient Egypt, and they were historically popular as 
                         symbols of ancient Egypt in the Western imagination. They became 
                         famous in Hellenistic times, when the Great Pyramid was listed by the 
                         Greek poet Antipater as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. 
                         They are by far the oldest and only surviving ancient wonders of the 
                         world.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         And the pyramids, according to one of the hypotheses, are royal 
                         tombs, each of which bears the name of the king who built it and was 
                         buried in it, and the hierarchical construction is a stage in the 
                         development of tomb architecture in ancient Egypt. Then it developed 
                         to take the form of a step pyramid by the engineer Imhotep, the 
                         minister of the pharaoh and King Djoser in the Third Dynasty.
                         This was followed by two attempts by King Senefru, founder of the 
                         Fourth Dynasty, to build a complete hierarchical form. However, the 
                         backs of the two pyramids are not correct in shape, and they are 
                         located in Dahshur, one of them has a flattened base, and the other has 
                         a smaller shape, about half the size of the first. The engineer, 
                         Hemyuno, the architect of King Khufu, was able to achieve the ideal 
                         pyramidal shape, and he built the pyramid of Khufu in Giza on an 
                         area of 13 acres, and the pyramids of Khafre and Menkaure followed.
                         The pyramid shape was associated with the ancient Egyptians with 
                         the idea of the creation of the universe, and they also believed, 
                         according to some of their writings and religious texts, that the 
                         pyramid is a means that helps the soul of the deceased reach the sky

                               <p>The Great Sphinx is a statue of a mythical creature with the body of a 
                                 lion and the head of a human. It was carved from limestone, and it is 
                                 likely that it was originally covered with a layer of plaster and 
                                  colored, and traces of the original colors are still visible next to one of 
                                  its ears.
                                  Located on the Giza Plateau on the west bank of the Nile in Giza, 
                                  Egypt, the Great Sphinx is also the guardian of the plateau. It is the 
                                 oldest known colossal sculpture, its length is about 73.5 meters, 
                                  including 15 meters the length of its front feet, its width is 19.3 
                                  meters, and its highest height from the surface of the earth is about 20 
                                 meters to the top of the head. It is believed that the ancient Egyptians 
                                  built it during the reign of King Khafra (2558 BC -2532 BC), the 
                                   builder of the Middle Pyramid in Giza.

                                 It is believed that the Sphinx was quarried before King Khafre 
                                 thought of carving it in the form of a statue, and this statue looks to 
                                    the east, so the original directions were changed in the last century to 
                                    match the Sphinx's view

                    <p>Qaitbay Citadel is located at the end of Pharos Island in the 
                        far west of Alexandria. It was built in the place of the 
                        ancient lighthouse of Alexandria, which was destroyed in 
                        the year 702 AH, following the devastating earthquake 
                        that occurred during the reign of Sultan Al-Nasir 
                        Muhammad bin Qalawun. Sultan Al-Ashraf Abu Al-Nasr 
                        Qaitbay began building this castle in the year 882 AH and 
                        finished From its construction in the year 884 AH.
                        The reason for his interest in Alexandria was the many 
                        direct threats to Egypt from the Ottoman Empire, which 
                        threatened the entire Arab region. The Mamluk Sultan 
                        Qansuh al-Ghuri took care of the castle, increasing its 
                        importance and charging it with weapons.</p>
                    <h4><b>Description</b></h4>
                    <p>
                        The main tower in the inner courtyard takes the form of a 
                        large square-shaped castle with a side length of 30 meters 
                        and a height of 17 meters. The castle consists of three 
                        square floors, and in the four corners of the tower there 
                        are semi-circular towers that end at the top with 
                        prominent balconies. These towers are higher than the 
                        main tower, and include openings for shooting arrows on 
                        two levels. The first floor is occupied by the castle mosque, 
                        which consists of a courtyard, four iwans, and defensive 
                        passages that allow soldiers to pass easily during the 
                        defense operations of the castle. This mosque had a 
                        minaret, but it collapsed recently.</p>
                        <p>As for the second floor, it contains corridors, halls, and 
                            internal rooms. The third floor includes a large room (the 
                            seat of Sultan Qaytbay) in which he sits to see the ships 
                            throughout the day from Alexandria, covered by a cross 
                            vault. There is also an oven on this floor for preparing 
                            wheat bread, as well as a mill for grinding grain for the 
                            soldiers residing in the castle. Sultan Qansuh al-Ghuri 
                            renewed the castle and increased its garrison. This castle 
                            was neglected during the Ottoman Caliphate period of 
                            Egypt.</p>
                            <p>This castle was built by Sultan Al-Malik Al-Ashraf Abu Al-Nasr Qaytbay Al-Mahmoudi in the year 882 AH / 1477 AD, 
                                in place of the old lighthouse of Alexandria, after he went 
                                to the site of the old lighthouse and ordered to build a 
                                tower on its old foundation, known later as the Citadel or 
                                Tabia of Qaytbay, and the construction was completed two 
                                years after the date of Construction, and historical sources 
                                indicate that the castle was built with some of the stones 
                                of the ancient vanished lighthouse, and not in the same 
                                place only, and the lighthouse itself was built with some of 
                                the ruins of ancient Pharaonic cities such as Memphis and 
                                Thebes</p>
                                <p>And because Qaitbay Citadel in Alexandria is one of the 
                                    most important castles on the Mediterranean coast, the 
                                    sultans and rulers of Egypt have paid attention to it 
                                    throughout the historical ages. It also contains models, 
                                    photographs, manuscripts, oil paintings, artifacts, 
                                    and antiquities from the Stone Age, Pharaonic, 
                                    Greco-Roman, Coptic, Arabic, Sudanese 
                                    civilization, and the modern era. The museum site 
                                    overlooks a natural lake, Ain al-Sira Lake.</p>

                    <h4><b>Description</b></h4>
                    <p>The Egyptian Museum is the oldest archaeological 
                        museum in the Middle East, and houses the 
                        largest collection of ancient Egyptian antiquities 
                        in the world. The museum displays a large 
                        collection that extends from the pre-dynastic 
                        period to the Greek and Roman eras.
                        The architect for the building was chosen through 
                        an international competition in 1895, which was 
                        the first of its kind, and was won by French 
                        architect Marcel Dorgnon. Khedive Abbas Helmy 
                        II inaugurated the museum in 1902, and it has 
                        become a historical landmark in downtown Cairo, 
                        home to some of the finest pieces of ancient 
                        Egyptian antiquities.</p> 
                        <h4><b>Museum Library</b></h4>
                        <p>The library of the museum was established since 
                            its opening, and a sum of money was allocated 
                            since 1899 to buy books, and the Egyptologist 
                            Maspero demanded that a permanent sum be 
                            allocated for the purchase of books, and Dacros 
                            was appointed as its first curator during the 
                            period from 1903 to 1906, Then he was 
                            succeeded by several trustees, until Monier, who 
                            prepared a comprehensive catalog of the library’s 
                            contents until 1926. Then the important shift for 
                            the library was when Abdul Mohsen al-Khashab 
                            took over the management of the library, and Diaa 
                            al-Din Abu Ghazi worked with him, who then took 
                            over the library’s secretariat in 1950 and had a 
                            role Important in preparing book catalogs, 
                            increasing external exchange, and expanding the 
                            library so that its current size has two floors, two 
                            reading halls, and a print store. The library 
                            includes more than 50,000 books and volumes of 
                            the rarest books in the field of ancient Egyptian, 
                            Greek, Roman and ancient Near East antiquities.
                            In addition to other disciplines, the most 
                            important of these books are “The Book of 
                            Description of Egypt,” “The Book of Antiquities of 
                            Egypt and Nubia,” and “The Book of Lepsius.” The 
                            library also contains a rare collection of maps, 
                            paintings, and photographs.

                    <h4><b>Description</b></h4>
                    <p>
                        It is an archaeological site in southern Egypt on the western bank of Lake Nasser, and is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. It contains double temples carved from the mountains in the thirteenth century BC, and it was a permanent monument to King Ramesses II and Queen Nefertari. The temples were completely moved to an artificial hill above the High Dam reservoir in Aswan to protect them from sinking due to the construction of the artificial reservoir. Abu Simbel is one of the most important tourist areas in Egypt.                        <p>The Rayyan Valley is characterized by its integrated desert environment, including sand dunes, natural eyes, different vegetation and varied animals, as well as marine fossils. The waterfall area is also considered to be one of the different areas of marine sports. The reserve has 15 species of wild animals, the most important of which are (white deer, Egyptian deer, funk fox, sand fox, wolf) and several falcons.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        The great temple in Abu Simbel was built during the reign of Ramesses the Great and construction took about 24 years. It is dedicated to the god Amun, Ra-Harakhty, Ptah and Ramesses. The temple features four colossal statues of the pharaoh, up to 20 meters tall, that adorn the facade of the temple and represent Ramesses II seated on a throne.
                    </p>
<p>There is also the hypostyle hall, which is supported by eight huge columns and features images of battle scenes waged by the ruler in military campaigns. The temple also includes a hall of pillars, which has four corners decorated with beautiful scenes of offerings to the gods. The temple is distinguished by its triangular design, which is followed by most ancient Egyptian temples. The axis of the temple was placed in a special way so that it would be repeated twice a year, on October 22 and February 21, when the sun's rays penetrate the temple and shed light on the statue.
    Of course, the Abu Simbel Temple is considered one of the most famous temples in ancient Egypt and is located on the banks of the Nile River in southern Egypt, specifically in the city of Abu Simbel, which was known in ancient times as "Yibes", and the temple is considered one of the most important monuments in ancient Egypt.
    </p>               
<p>A major operation was undertaken to save the temple from drowning after the construction of the Aswan Dam in the sixties of the last century, as the temple was moved and installed in another place near its original location, at a distance of about 64 meters, in order to protect it from the high water level of the Nile.
    The small temple was built for the goddess Hathor, Ramses II and his wife Nefertari, and it was built 100 meters from the temple of Ramses II. The temple contains statues of the king and queen of equal size, and Queen Nefertari allocated an important place in the temple, and the statues included princes and princesses along with their parents.
    </p>                
<p>
    The temple contains a pillared hall supported by six columns, and statues of the gods Horus, Khnum, Thuth, Isis, Satis, and Tawert. Each temple had its own priest who represented the king in the daily religious rituals, and the expansion of art and science education was necessary for the high priest to become a person qualified to perform this role.

                    <p>
                        The ancient Library of Alexandria, known as the Royal Library of Alexandria or the Great Library, is the largest library of its time. The library was exposed to many fires and its life ended in the year 48 BC. In 2002 it was rebuilt under the name of the New Library of Alexandria.
                        Historians differed about the person who built the library. Some say that Alexander put it in his planning when building Alexandria, and he is the owner of the idea of building it. Some say that Ptolemy the First built it, and others say that it was founded by Ptolemy II, given that he was the one who completed it. Ptolemy the First was the one who ordered the establishment the library and its organization at his expense, then his successor, Ptolemy II, completed an architectural and thematic plan that expresses the balance of Greek thought and the sciences of the time. There is a difference in the year in which it was established, as there are those who say that it was established in 330 BC, and there are those who say that it was established in 288 BC.
                  <h4><b>The library in the twenty-first century:</b></h4>
                    <p>
                        The library was revived in a huge project undertaken by Egypt in partnership with UNESCO, where the library was rebuilt in a location close to the old library.
                        <p>The library has a large collection of books estimated at 2 million books at the beginning of 2013, selected in Arabic, English and French, as well as a selection of books in other European languages such as German, Italian, Spanish and other rare languages such as Creole, Haitian and Zulu. The current collection includes sources from donors from all over the world in various topics.</p>

                                                The museum is distinguished by the presence of a grille 
within the museum’s campus, which was first discovered 
in 1932, and rediscovered during the excavation process 
prior to building the museum in 2003-2004. The grille is 
composed of three rows of double eyes, each with 13 eyes. 
On the north side, there are 13 single springs supported by 
a brick wall. 
The springs were built of small red bricks separated by a 
50 cm wide corridor, and each group of eyes was 
separated by a 20 cm wide brick wall. The eyes are round, 
80 cm in diameter and 70 cm in height. On the north side, 
there are 10 rectangular basins, measuring 70 x 70 cm and 
90 cm high, separated by a corridor 65 cm wide. These 
vats are believed to be used to fix the dye after the dyeing 
process.
