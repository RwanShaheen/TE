                    <h4><b>Description</b></h4>
                    <p>Dahab is an Egyptian tourist city belonging to the South 
                        Sinai Governorate and is located on the Gulf of Aqaba, 
                        about 100 km away from the city of Sharm el-Sheikh 
                        and 87 km from the city of Nuweiba, and it was named 
                        after the color of its golden sand.
                        The city is divided into two parts, the first is located in 
                        the south and is called the village of Al-Asla and is 
                        famous for the simple Bedouin life.
                        The second section is located in the north and is 
                        considered the soul and pulse of the city because it

                            was neglected during the Ottoman Caliphate period of 
                            Egypt.</p>

                    <h4><b>Description</b></h4>
                    <p>Have you ever thought about walking inside a swimming pool without getting wet, or walking through a vibrating tunnel, or standing on your head in a room? The answer lies in the Egyptian Museum of Illusions.</p> 
                   <p>The Egyptian Museum of Illusions offers a unique entertainment experience with illusion games that test visitors' senses and minds. It is the first of its kind in Egypt and aims to simplify complex concepts through creative and entertaining educational facts. The museum features around 70 games based on visual, sensory, and mental illusions, as well as maze-like rooms and a gift shop with brain-teaser games and unique decorations.</p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>AMES Room</li>
                    <p>The Ames Room appears to be a regular room from the outside, but in reality, it is creatively distorted. It deceives the senses and makes you appear gigantic at the front of the room and dwarfed at the back, giving the illusion that a person can grow and shrink just by changing their position. This demonstrates the ingenuity of the design. It is especially amusing to have designated spots for photographers and visitors, resulting in wonderfully humorous photos.</p>
                    <li>Anti-gravity Room</li>
                    <p>A room far from reality, where inside, you don't know what is right and what is wrong. The dimensions of the room create a new perception for the mind, defying the laws of physics and gravity. It's fun to capture souvenir photos in various positions, where your mind makes inconceivable inferences that can only be understood through experience, leaving you amazed.</p>
                    <li>Head on the Platter</li>
                    <p>Can you imagine cutting off your head and placing it on a platter?</p>
                    <p>That's what happens with this trick, where your head appears alone on the platter while the rest of your body remains inside the box beneath the platter. It would be wonderful to capture a picture in this position.</p>
                    <li>Beuchet Chair Illusion</li>
                    <p>It's illogical for a person's size to change based on their location, but that's exactly what the Beuchet Chair does. The dimensions of the room deceive your mind, making it enjoyable to see a person sitting on this chair appear smaller. It represents a new experience in understanding perception, proportions, and dimensions.</p>
                   </ol>
